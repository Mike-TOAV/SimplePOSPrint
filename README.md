A solution for those with a thermal receipt printer and linux, this software and accompanying chrome plugins allow you to bypass cups, and have your web based POS software print receipts directly to the printer. (This software is very early in development, please feel free to fork it and improve upon it)

I hope this can become heavily useful for those IT Admins that are struggling with CUPS and the generic POS80 Thermal printers available today. If you have are able to improve upon this please feel free to and let me know about it: mike@taovdistro.co.uk.
